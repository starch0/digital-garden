Remember that teacher? The one who insisted that math exists in **EVERYTHING** around you? At the time, perhaps you were like, "Nah, that's bullshit". But now, as an adult, you've likely come to realize that your former teacher was, in fact, right. Math isn't just confined to textbooks; it's the underlying structure of the world we live in.

In this article (or rather, this series of articles), I'll dive into the world of mathematics, building from the ground up. Our goal is to demystify math and show you its practical relevance and maybe, make you like it a little more.

Here's what we'll cover to start:
